# Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit using supervised machine learning techniques.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas 
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository Bank Marketing Dataset

## Analysis Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ handled missing values, renamed columns, corrected data types  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distribution of age, job types, and education levels
- Subscription rate by contact type and day of the week
- Correlation between numerical features
- Class imbalance check (subscribed vs. not subscribed)
